# Open Spot

This repository contains the source code and related documentation for the Open Spot app.

Open Spot is a mobile application that allows athletes and sports enthusiasts to discover and locate ideal training spots for their favourite sports. 

## Motivations

I began this project as a way to show proficiency in technical and soft skills, thinking about this, I included technical topics such as state management, and hooks implementation, to solve requirements such as multilanguage, forecast climate, and a flow user experience.

Throughout this development I've learned about, graphic design, user experience, mobile software development, frontend architecture patterns, Javascript, Maps API, and Firebase, in addition, to solving many technical troubles related to development and deployment.
